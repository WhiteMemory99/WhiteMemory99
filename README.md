### Oh, hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a backend developer that mainly uses __Python__... And _secretly_ loves __Kotlin__, but don't tell anyone! I also
play around with __Rust__ sometimes.  
ðŸš€ Lately, I've been focused on
developing [Python Inlay Params](https://github.com/WhiteMemory99/Intellij-Python-Inlay-Params) plugin.
